Building a C OS based off of the OS in 1000 lines
My plan is to do some tweaking of my own, and get it running on a Raspberry Pi 0 eventually.

If I end up having the time I'll try porting it to zig as well as a learning project.

## Features I'll need to add myself
* Interrupt Handling
* Timer Processing
* Inter-process communication
* Multi-processor support
